# Video Tagger

A command-line tool that automatically renames video files with embedded metadata including resolution, duration, and a checksum.

## Description

Video Tagger scans and processes video files, embedding important metadata directly into the filename. This makes it easy to identify video characteristics without needing to open the file or use specialized software.

Each processed file is renamed with the following format:

```
original_filename_[resolution][duration_in_min][CRC32_checksum].extension
```

For example:

```
vacation_video.mp4 â†’ vacation_video_[1920x1080][45min][A1B2C3D4].mp4
```

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.16 or later
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (specifically, the `ffprobe` binary must be available in your PATH)
