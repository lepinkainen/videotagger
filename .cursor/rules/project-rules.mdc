# Project Rules

## Core Guidelines

- **Language:** Go only (no Python or other languages)
- **Build System:** Use Taskfile
- **Unit Tests:** Write basic unit tests for new functionality. Always check the tests pass after finishing changes.
- **Purpose:** See README.md for project definition

## Implementation Requirements

- Maintain consistent Go style and idiomatic patterns
- Follow the existing architectural patterns
- Each data source processor should be implemented as a separate command
